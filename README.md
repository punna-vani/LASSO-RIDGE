# LASSO-RIDGE
 Lasso and Ridge regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Lasso adds L1 regularization by shrinking less important features to zero, while Ridge adds L2 regularization by reducing the weights of all features. They help improve model performance and feature selection. ðŸ“‰ðŸ§ªðŸ§±
